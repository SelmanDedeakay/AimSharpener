# AimSharpener
Aim Sharpener is a click-game created by using Tkinter.

The goal is click the buttons as many as you can possibly click in 30 seconds.

Game has 2 different modes: Normal & Hard.

There is no differencies between them except Hard Mode's buttons size.

In the "cheat" folder, you will see a little script that does auto-click the buttons in NORMAL MODE.

Script doesn't support the Hard Mode.

Possibly, you have to install OpenCV on your PC. (You can use "pip install opencv-python" command on cmd if you have pip installer on your PC.)

And finally, script is created by using PyAutoGUI.
